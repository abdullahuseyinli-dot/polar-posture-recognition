# Third-party notices

The repository's MIT License covers the original source code and documentation.
It does not replace the terms of source images, dataset annotations, framework
code, or pretrained model parameters.

## COCO source images

`data/manifest.csv` records COCO image URLs, labels, fixed splits, and checksums;
the image files are downloaded by the user and are not redistributed by this
repository. Under the [COCO terms of use](https://cocodataset.org/#termsofuse),
COCO annotations and the COCO website are licensed under CC BY 4.0. The COCO
Consortium does not own the image copyrights, so every image remains subject to
its original Flickr/source terms. Users are responsible for confirming that
their intended use is permitted.

Four qualitative COCO/Flickr photo composites from the original study tags are
excluded from this standalone repository. Their original paths and exclusion are
recorded in `results/project_origin.json`; the historical Git record remains in
the companion ARFTR repository. Numerical tables do not depend on redistributing
those photographs.

## POLAR dataset

The scale study uses POLAR version 1 from Mendeley Data under the licence stated
on the [dataset record](https://doi.org/10.17632/hvnsh7rwz7.1). The release is
downloaded and verified locally; no POLAR image is committed or redistributed.
Although the dataset record is marked CC BY 4.0, its metadata identifies Getty
source filenames. Getty and other upstream image rights are not relicensed by
this project. Users must obtain the release from its publisher and assess whether
their intended use is permitted.

## V-COCO external dataset

The external-transfer audit uses V-COCO annotations and locally obtained COCO images.
No V-COCO annotation archive or source image is committed. V-COCO is provided for
research use through its [official repository](https://github.com/s-gupta/v-coco), and
the underlying images retain the COCO/source-image terms described above.

## DINOv2-Small and DINOv2-Base

The DINOv2-Small and DINOv2-Base pretrained models are developed by Meta AI and
distributed under
the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2/blob/main/LICENSE).
The upstream [model card](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md)
documents the model's intended uses, limitations, and training-data context.

## DINOv3-Base

The matched V-COCO screen and current POLAR benchmark use the gated
[`facebook/dinov3-vitb16-pretrain-lvd1689m`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vitb16-pretrain-lvd1689m)
checkpoint under Meta's [DINOv3 License](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3/blob/main/LICENSE.md),
not this repository's MIT licence. Access must be obtained from the provider.
No weights or credentials are distributed. See `docs/DINOV3_ACCESS.md` for the
historical screen and `docs/REPRESENTATIONS.md` for the POLAR checkpoint and
processor-reconstruction caveat.

## SigLIP2-Base

The POLAR benchmark and V-COCO follow-ups use Google's
[`siglip2-base-patch16-224`](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-base-patch16-224)
model. Refer to its provider model card and licence for use of the pretrained
parameters. This repository distributes only experiment code and numerical results,
not the model weights.

## ConvNeXt-Small and torchvision

ConvNeXt-Small is loaded with torchvision's `IMAGENET1K_V1` pretrained weights.
The torchvision source is distributed under the
[BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/LICENSE).
Torchvision notes that pretrained models can also be subject to terms derived
from their training data; those upstream rights are not relicensed here.

## ConvNeXt V2

The current POLAR benchmark also uses a pretrained ConvNeXt V2-Base encoder.
See the [official implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt-V2)
and the checkpoint provider's model card for the applicable parameter and data
terms. Neither the checkpoint nor its training images are redistributed here.

## PyTorch Grad-CAM

The attribution evaluator uses the ROAD noisy-linear imputer from
[PyTorch Grad-CAM](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam), distributed
under the [MIT License](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam/blob/master/LICENSE).
The Grad-CAM, HiResCAM, integrated-gradients, and transformer-rollout maps in
this repository are implemented locally so they can differentiate the exact
calibrated ensemble score used by the locked experiment.

No third-party framework source or pretrained model checkpoint is committed to
this repository.
